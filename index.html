    <h2 id="approach">Enabling IT to function the way it's meant to</h2>
    <p>If you are here, it's likely your IT organization isn't operating at exceptional levels.</p>
    <p>Do you have an IT product or service that you are struggling to take to market? Perhaps you are in a situation where releases are consistently late or disconnected from business needs and the moral of IT staff is low? Perhaps the organization needs to grow and mature so more products or services are released, but adding staff seems to <i>reduce</i> productivity? Another common situation with IT is key energetic figures that held the organization together when it was smaller are either gone or overtaxed with the organization's current size and scope. Perhaps you simply seek experienced consultation in IT Management, Architecture, Development, Security, or Performance.</p>
    <p>These are the types of situations that truly test an IT organization and it can be a great help to have someone on-hand who understands the reality and complexity of IT. Robert's approach is holis­tic pro­vid­ing at­ten­tion where it is needed most to improve IT results whether it is lead­er­ship, in­no­va­tion, process op­ti­miza­tion, ar­chi­tec­ture, or development technology changes.</p>
    <p>Whether you are looking for a 1-week assessement of your IT environment or a 6-month transformation of an IT project or organization, <a href="#contact">contact</a> Robert to discuss a potential engagement.</p>
