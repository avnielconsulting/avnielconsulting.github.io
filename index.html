    <h2 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h2>
    <p><i>Robert Peterson is an uncommon kind of leader: both devotional and rational. He is as devoted to the beauty of a solution as he is to its efficacy. He is among a rare group of exceptional consultants and researchers where he has distinguished himself through his patents, books and applications. What’s even more valuable than his accomplishments, in my view, is his rapid grasp of complexity, his total engagement, and his gracious leadership through difficulties. You will enjoy both the process and the result of working with Robert. &mdash; P.B., University Chancellor</i></p>
    <p><i>Robert brings a breadth of skills to his clients. He excels at helping them chart a path to their desired outcome and understand the technology tradeoffs for achieving those goals. He can readily map the solution to a broad technology base to ensure clients are building an optimal solution. He is also technically hands on and can quickly prove out concepts with rapid prototyping. I highly recommend him to teams that look to be more agile or transform their technology infrastructure. &mdash; M. Gilfix, IBM Vice President</i></p>
    <p><i>Robert operates with heart and mind. He listens with care to include and incorporate others' perspectives and capabilities. He aims to create win-win solutions so that all have buy-in, creating powerful outcomes. This care and skill greatly complements his evident intellect and creative ingenuity. &mdash; Megan White, Nonprofit CEO</i></p>
    <p><i>I have had the pleasure to work with Robert as a colleague and was always pleased with his high level of technical expertise. Collaborating with Robert always resulted in the highest level solution possible. Robert is very professional in all aspects and hope I get the opportunity to work with Robert in the future! &mdash; John Darden, Qvantel Associate Director</i></p>
